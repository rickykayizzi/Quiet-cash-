  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Quiet Cash was created to help people take control of their everyday money. Many of us still handle cash daily, and it’s easy to lose track of where it goes. Our mission is to make money management simple, personal, and accessible — no complicated jargon, just tools that help you spend smarter and save more.</p>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Quiet Cash started as a personal project by <strong>Kayizzi Richard</strong>, who wanted an easy way to record cash expenses and reduce unnecessary losses. What began as a simple tracker grew into a lightweight app designed for anyone — students, workers, small business owners — who wants to understand their cash flow better. We believe that managing money should be as quiet and simple as possible, without stress or confusion.</p>

  <h2>Why Quiet Cash?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ Focused on cash — perfect for communities where cash is still king.</li>
    <li>✔ Simple and fast — no need for complicated setups.</li>
    <li>✔ Helps build good habits — track, save, and grow over time.</li>
  </ul>
